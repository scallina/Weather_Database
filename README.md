# Weather_Database
## In this project, I used weather description data to enhance the a route mapping app. Next, I had a beta testers use input statements to filter the data for their weather preferences, which I used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. The beta tester then chose four cities from the list of potential travel destinations to create a travel itinerary. Finally, using the Geoapify Routing API, I created a travel route between the four cities and a marker layer map.
